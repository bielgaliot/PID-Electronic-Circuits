# PID-Electronic-Circuits
Creation of a PID feedback control for the inclination of a helix-propelled pendulum

Made for Arduino Uno. Definitive PID is in Tasca9bis. The next ones after that allow for a MATLAB plot of the inclination vs the desired inclination. Code comments are in catalan. Problem despcription is available on demand.
